TA for two programming labs consisting of 110 students. I am responsible for answer questions related to projects that 
involve many advanced python concepts, i.e., OOP concepts, file reading/writing, database access, GUI creation, and more.
Beyond my lab duties, I grade these projects and provide feedback.
