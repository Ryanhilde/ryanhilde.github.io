Instructor for a class of 25 students where I split them into project teams and tasked them with creating a java application for a coffee ordering system.
Each week the students were required to show their progress and new features. At the end of the course, 12 groups had their own functioning java application. In this course, I taught them elements of class design, abstract data types, design patterns, and the basis of algorithmic design.
