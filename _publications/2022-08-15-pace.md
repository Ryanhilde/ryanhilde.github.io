In this Research-In-Progress work, we present a potentially generalizable approach that can determine the sensitivity of an attribute or a set of attributes associated with an event in a given event log. This approach is based on the concept of an equivalence class that a given event or trace may form and associate its sensitivity with the size of its equivalence class. For a given event, different equivalent classes can be formed based on different attributes, the proposed approach provides researchers with a more granular tool to apply group based privacy to event logs.
