Research experience
======
2022 - Present
* Graduate Student Researcher with a focus on Data Privacy in the [Distributed Systems and Middleware group](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~dsm/members.html) at the University of California, Irvine.
  * Member of the NSF-funded [Smart WAter Data Exchange (SWADE) project](https://sites.uci.edu/swade/).
    * Focused on privacy issues in water infrastructure.
  * Investigating composition of privacy techniques in smart meter and infrastructure systems.
  * Working with a smart sprinkler company to develop a recommendation system for irrigation usage.
  * Applying Homomorphic Encryption to Meter Readings based on user-policy to metered environments.
  
2020 - 2022
* Data privacy and Process Mining researcher in the [Integrating Cyber Innovations within the Physical World lab](https://icip.sdsu.edu/) at San Diego State University.
  * Investigated generalizable privacy schemes within workflows and created the [PMDG: Privacy for Multi-perspective Process Mining through Data Generalization framework](https://github.com/Ryanhilde/PMDG_Framework).
  * Conducted [experiments for finding better bounds of Quasi-Identifiers](https://github.com/Ryanhilde/min_set_cover) in the [K-Anonymity selection problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13882).
  * Process mining researcher exploring privacy, anomalies and, filtering of event logs.
    * Developed a framework for generalizing attribute values based on semantic properties within organization workflows and measured the results using various unsupervised machine learning techniques.
    * Conducted experiments for anomaly detection in mainstream process behavior using clustering techniques.
    * Conducted experiments for filtering mainstream behavior of event logs.

Work experience
======
2018-2022
* Quality Control Manager, New Patient Machine
  * Oversaw and Managed the creation of Facebook and Google Ad campaigns for 40 clients.
