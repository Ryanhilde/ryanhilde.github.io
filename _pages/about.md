I am a Ph.D. student and researcher in the [Distributed Systems and Middleware Group (DSM)](https://pages.github.com) at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu). I am advised by [Dr. Nalini Venkatasubramanian](https://nalini.ics.uci.edu/) and focus on applications of data privacy. Additionally, I am part of the [Information Systems Group (ISG)](https://isg.ics.uci.edu/) at UCI.
